# PwC Job Simulation Portfolio
This repository contains my portfolio of Power BI projects using real-world data from Forage. I created this portfolio for academic purposes and self-learning. It includes two small tasks: Call Centre Trends and Customer Retention.

### Instructions for Power BI File (.pbix)
1. Install the latest version of Power BI.
2. Open the .pbix file as usual.
## Project 1: Call Centre Trends
This project involves creating a dashboard in Power BI for Claire, showcasing all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics from the dataset.

#### KPIs include:
* Overall customer satisfaction
* Overall calls answered/abandoned
* Calls by time
* Average speed of answer
* Agent performance quadrant: comparing average handle time (talk duration) versus the number of calls answered
## Project 2: Customer Retention
In this project, I focus on customer retention for a telecom company. The Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the PwC engagement partner to discuss key points:
Telecom customers are hard to acquire, so retaining them is crucial.
The retention department is responsible for winning back customers who terminate their contracts.
Currently, the company reaches out only after customers have terminated their contracts, which is reactionary. It would be better to predict who is at risk of leaving.
Previous customer analyses in Excel have not yielded actionable insights.
#### Task Objective:
For this task, I need to define the proper KPIs and create a Power BI dashboard for the Retention Manager, reflecting these KPIs.
The churn dashboard includes:
* Demographic insights: Percentages of gender, senior citizens, partners, and dependents
* Customer Account Information
* Retention metrics:
% of men, 
% of women, 
% of leavers, 
% of employees promoted (FY21), 
% of women promoted, 
% of hires (men and women), 
% of turnover,
