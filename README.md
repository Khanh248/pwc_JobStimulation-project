# PwC Job Stimulation Portfolio
This repository contains my portfolio of power BI project using real-world data from Forage. 
I practiced this repository for academic and self-learning. It includes 2 small tasks: Call Centre Trends and Customer Retention.

## Instructions for Power BI File (.pbix)
Install the lastest version of Power BI
Open the .pbix file as usual. 
## Project Call Centre Trends
The project requires a dashboard in Power BI for Claire that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.

### KPIs include:
* Overall customer satisfaction
* Overall calls answered/abandoned
* Calls by time
* Average speed of answer
* Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered
## Project Customer Retention
#### To better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points: 
* Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
* The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
* Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
We have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end

#### In this task, I need to define proper KPIs and create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs. 
The Churnboard including:
* Demographic illsutrates the percentage of gender, Senior citizen, Partner, Dependents 
* Customer Account Information
* % of men, % of women, % of leavers, % employees promoted (FY21), % of women promoted, % of hires men, % of hires women, % turnover.
* Customer Risk Analysis
